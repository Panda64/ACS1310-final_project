# Travel Tracker

This is an alpha build of a react app that allows users to track the places they have travelled to.

## Current Functionality

- Users can enter their name to create their custom travel tracker
- Users can navigate around a world map to select the countries they have been to
- Upon a country being selected, the region will then turn green, indicating that the user has visited that country.

## Future Functionality

There is a large amount on the table for what I want to do with this project in the near future, but here are some of the main ideas I have in mind:

- Detailed statistics on the countries visited (see [live deployment](https://jayjay.me/ACS1320-final_project/) for planned statistics)
- Ability to save travel profile as a PDF
- Seperate USA map for a USA specific travel profile

## Usage

Although still in early stages, you can check out the site [here](https://jayjay.me/ACS1320-final_project/).
